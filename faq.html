        <h3>What are the advantages of Screenclass® over the regular learning in the classroom?</h3>
        <div class='content'> 
          Screenclass has lot of advantages over the regular learning in classrooms.

          Some of these are:
          <ul>
          <li><h5>Flexibility:</h5>In the regular type of learning, students usually have fixed routine of 
            sitting together and learning from the instructor. The duration of the class is fixed. 
            The topics to be discussed in the class are also fixed. This is different with Screenclass®. 
            Learning on Screenclass® is very flexible. Students can learn whatever they want, 
            whenever they want, wherever they want. Students decide what they want to study and 
            for how much time they have to do so.</li>

         <li><h5>Prompt Access to Varied Resources:</h5> Students need access to different kinds of resources. 
            These resources can be information, notes, theories, diagrams etc. On Screenclass® these 
            resources are available to the students at all the time of the day.</li>

          <li><h5> Prompt Feedback Mechanism:</h5> In regular learning, tests are taken by pen and paper, graded by 
            the teachers before the results are availed. This takes time and can be tedious. On Screenclass® 
            tests are taken through Computer Based Test (CBT) system. With this system, 
            test are administered immediately on completion of the courses and results are obtained immediately.</li>

          <li><h5>Higher Retention:</h5> In regular learning. Learning is delivered by conversation between the instructor 
            and the students. The use of smart technology is lesser in the regular teaching method. 
            A lot of concepts are abstract to the teacher and the learners! However on Screenclass®, 
            there is a substantial use of digital resources including presentations, multimedia involving 
            images, audio and videos, animations etc. With the use of these resources, students get to learn more, 
            visualize what they learn and engage more with the learning expectations. 
            They engage and understand better the things they see rather than read. Therefore, 
            Screenclass® increases the understanding and retention ability of the students.</li>

          <li><h5>Cost Effectiveness:</h5> Students engaged in regular learning have to go to school or institute 
          regularly. This may involve transportation and associated costs. Facility maintenance cost of the 
          school, rent, and other costs add up to increase the tuition charged. However, on Screenclass®, 
          these costs are eliminated. Learners have access to resources from anywhere they are without 
          transport costs. Other factors which increase the cost of learning are eliminated on Screenclass® 
          making Screenclass® more cost effective.</li>

          <li><h5> Greener Approach: </h5>The regular learning method uses pen and paper. 
          Even tests are conducted on a pen-paper medium. These papers are made by 
          cutting down trees. Pencils are also made of wood. Transportation to and 
          from the school by the students and teachers increases pollutions. However, 
          learning on Screenclass® is purely digital. There is no need for papers and pens. 
          Everything can be noted using electronic devices. Screenclass® complies with the greener approach.</li>

          <li><h5> Faster Learning:</h5> In regular learning, the speed of learning depends on the number of student available, 
          number of classrooms available and the limited time period of a class. But on Screenclass®, 
          learning speed depends on the speed and pace of the student.</li>

          <li><h5>Easy Updating:</h5> In regular learning methods notes have to be regularly updated by the students. 
            This takes a lot of time. But on Screenclass® notes are simply downloaded by the students. 
            So they are automatically updated.</li>

          <li>• Screenclass® eliminates cultural and religious barriers to learning, reduces security treats to schools 
            and learning facilities in volatile regions, eliminates students proximity to learning facilities and 
            centers, eliminates unwarranted extra – curricular activities, while raising content viability and 
            delivery, upgrading users experience, increasing the standards of education and generally stimulating 
            students interest in learning!</li>
          </ul>
